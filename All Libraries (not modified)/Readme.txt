The code uses a variety of libraries and headers, each serving a specific purpose in managing the ESP32 device, modem, MQTT communication, ADS1115 readings, and the Async WebServer. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the libraries and headers used:

1. TinyGsmClient.h
Library: TinyGSM
Purpose: This library is used to manage the communication with GSM/4G LTE modules like the SIM7600. It handles AT commands and provides support for GPRS connections. This is used for MQTT communication over GPRS.
Key Usage: TinyGsm modem(SerialAT); is used to create a modem instance, and TinyGsmClient client(modem); is used for communication over TCP/IP.

2. PubSubClient.h
Library: PubSubClient
Purpose: This library is used for MQTT communication, allowing the ESP32 to act as a client that can connect to MQTT brokers, publish messages, and subscribe to topics.
Key Usage: PubSubClient mqtt(client); initializes an MQTT client.

3. WiFi.h
Library: WiFi (ESP32 Core)
Purpose: Manages the Wi-Fi functionalities of the ESP32, allowing it to act as a Wi-Fi access point (AP) or station (STA). It's used to set up the ESP32 as a Soft Access Point for the web server.
Key Usage: WiFi.softAP("ESP32_AP"); sets up an AP mode for the ESP32.

4. AsyncTCP.h
Library: AsyncTCP
Purpose: Provides asynchronous TCP communication for the ESP32. It is required for the asynchronous web server functionality.
Key Usage: Allows handling of TCP connections asynchronously.

5. Adafruit_ADS1X15.h
Library: Adafruit ADS1X15
Purpose: Provides support for the ADS1115 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) module. This allows the ESP32 to read analog inputs with greater precision.
Key Usage: Adafruit_ADS1115 ads; is used to create an ADS1115 instance, and ads.readADC_SingleEnded() reads the ADC values from different channels.
