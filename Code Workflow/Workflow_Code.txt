The workflow of the code can be broken down into several key steps, each managing different functionalities of the ESP32 and the connected components (GSM module, MQTT, ADS1115, WebServer). Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code operates:

1. Preprocessor Setup and Global Variable Initialization
Libraries Imported: The necessary libraries for GSM, MQTT, Wi-Fi, ADS1115, and Async WebServer are included.
Hardware Pin Definitions:
RXD2, TXD2, and powerPin are defined to manage the hardware connections for the SIM7600 modem and power control.
Global Variables:
Variables like ch0, ch1, etc., are defined to hold sensor values from the ADS1115 ADC.
Topics for MQTT (publishTopic, subscribeTopic) and APN for LTE/GPRS connection are declared.
interval controls how often data is published to the MQTT broker.
2. setup() Function
This function sets up the environment, including initializing the GSM modem, the MQTT client, the ADS1115 ADC, and the Async Web Server.

Steps in setup():

Serial Communication:

The Serial monitor (SerialMon) is initialized for debugging, and SerialAT is initialized for communication with the modem via Serial1.
Modem Initialization:

The GSM module (SIM7600) is powered on using the powerPin.
modem.init() and modem.restart() are called to initialize and restart the GSM modem.
The modem connects to the network (modem.waitForNetwork()), and GPRS is activated (modem.gprsConnect(apn)).
ADS1115 Initialization:

The ADS1115 ADC is initialized to read analog sensor data. If initialization fails, it logs an error.
MQTT Setup:

The MQTT broker is defined and a callback function for receiving messages is set via mqtt.setCallback().
An attempt is made to connect to the MQTT broker (connectToMQTT()), and upon success, the ESP32 subscribes to the subscribeTopic.
Async WebServer:

The web server is initialized with startWebServer(), serving pages for sensor readings and status updates.
3. Main loop() Function
The main loop performs three key tasks:

Steps in loop():

MQTT Connection Handling:

The ESP32 checks if the MQTT connection is still active. If disconnected, it attempts to reconnect and re-subscribes to the subscribeTopic.
Publishing Sensor Data:

The loop checks if the interval time has passed. If so, it reads the sensor values from the ADS1115, prints them, and publishes them to the publishTopic via MQTT.
A try-catch block is used to handle any errors while reading from ADS1115.
Web Server Timeout:

If the web server has been running longer than serverTimeout, the stopWebServer() function is called to shut it down.
4. connectToMQTT() Function
This function attempts to establish a connection to the MQTT broker.

Steps in connectToMQTT():

The function checks if the ESP32 can connect to the broker. If successful, it returns true and subscribes to the desired topic. Otherwise, it logs the failure and returns false.
5. callback() Function
This function handles messages received on subscribed MQTT topics.

Steps in callback():

The ESP32 checks if the message came from the subscribeTopic. If so, it reads the message (interpreted as a time value), converts it to an integer, and adjusts the interval for data publishing accordingly.
6. startWebServer() Function
This function sets up the ESP32 as a web server using the Async WebServer library.

Steps in startWebServer():

The ESP32 is set up as an access point (AP mode) with WiFi.softAP("ESP32_AP").
Various routes are defined to serve HTTP GET requests:
/: Serves a welcome message.
/readings: Serves sensor readings in JSON format.
/params: Serves a status page showing the status of the network, MQTT, ADS1115, and sensor values.
The web server is started via server.begin().
7. stopWebServer() Function
This function stops the Async WebServer and disconnects the ESP32 from the access point.

Steps in stopWebServer():

The web server is stopped with server.end().
The ESP32 disconnects from the Wi-Fi AP using WiFi.softAPdisconnect(true).
8. getSignalStrength() Function
This function reads and returns the network signal strength from the modem.

Steps in getSignalStrength():

It calls modem.getSignalQuality() to retrieve the network signal strength (used mainly for debugging).
Workflow Overview
Initialization: Upon startup, the ESP32 powers the SIM7600 modem, connects to the LTE/GPRS network, and initializes the ADS1115 ADC and MQTT client.
Web Server: The ESP32 sets up an access point and web server, allowing users to interact via HTTP requests and view sensor data and device status.
MQTT Communication: The ESP32 connects to an MQTT broker, subscribes to topics, publishes sensor readings, and listens for time-based updates to control the data publishing interval.
Sensor Data Acquisition: Every interval milliseconds, the ESP32 reads sensor values from the ADS1115 and publishes them to the MQTT broker.
Web Server Timeout: The web server shuts down after running for a certain period (defined by serverTimeout).
This workflow allows the ESP32 to act as a sensor data collector and server, handling MQTT communication for real-time data exchange and offering a web interface for status monitoring.
